MetroMate for iOS.
=========

A beautifully designed guide to the Dubai Metro that I built back in May, 2013.**

This is the first time I publicly release my code. While I admit it might not look beautiful, it got the necessary job done. Everything is stuffed into 1 view controller class because I needed fine control over view transitions. This seemed like the quickest way back then. :P

If someone out there is looking to build a better guide to Dubai's public transport systems, I hope this'll help.

<h2>Features</h2>
* Train timings.
* ETA at destination.
* Nol Card balance checker.
* Automatic station detection.

<h2>Why the hardcoded timings for one station only?</h2>
Because I lived close to the Noor Bank station. All the other timings are based on the timings at Noor Bank. The RTA has no public API for fetching train timings.

<h2>About the Nol Card balance checker</h2>
As you might've guessed, the RTA doesn't provide public APIs for Nol Card services either. I had to figure out the server endpoint used by their official iOS app. Sometimes the service dies for no reason.
